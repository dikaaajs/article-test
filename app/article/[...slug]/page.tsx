In the ever-evolving world of digital product design, collaboration between designers and developers has always been a crucialâ€”yet often challengingâ€”part of the process. In April 2025, Figma introduced Dev Mode, a powerful new feature aimed at streamlining that collaboration more than ever before.

**ðŸ”§ What Is Dev Mode?**


Dev Mode is a new interface within Figma that provides developer-focused tools and removes unnecessary UI clutter that designers typically use. Instead, developers can view ready-to-implement specs, such as spacing, color values, font styles, and asset exportsâ€”without disrupting the design file or asking the design team for clarifications.
